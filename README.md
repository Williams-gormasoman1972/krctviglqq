Just walked outta the theater. The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep — my head’s still kinda buzzing from it, y'know? First off, whoever wrote the script must have had a late-night Tinder date with a sea monster because holy spoiler alert, do mermaids have issues! But, listen — underwater politics? Surprisingly hilarious. Like, do they have mer-student loans? Aren't they busy singin' about lost love while brushing kelp outta their hair? Who funds all these dazzling scale costumes, huh?!

By the way, I swear, someone could’ve dimmed the lights a notch. I mean, we’re in a theater, not at some dang solar observatory! Had to squint just to catch who was saying what through all the glittering tail flicks. Not gonna lie though, they nailed the “ocean blues.” Almost made me wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later if the ocean scenes were available on loop, minus the migraine drops, thanks.

> There was this scene where Geralt’s standing knee-deep in water, looking at some suspiciously well-groomed sea horses—one of them, I kid you not, turns and winks at him. Like, what? Maybe I missed something but is galloping through currents the new horseback riding?! 

Is it me, or is Yennefer’s sarcasm getting sharper than her spells? Feel us mortal minds melting, while pondering if love, revenge, and aquatic brawls make up a meaningful moral lesson. Probably not, but I’m here for it.

Ah, and don’t even get me started on the soundtrack — some might say synthy mermaid yodeling is what 2023 needed. Bold move, but it had me thinking more of dolphins on helium than a saga of swords and magic. But, you know, points for creativity? Or, maybe points deducted. Who keeps score anyway?

Let’s throw in some code, for no reason...

```python
fish_speed = 5
while geralt_on_water:
    if siren_song:
        geralt_sway += fish_speed
```

Leaving the theater, I felt like Geralt should have spent more time chatting with a therapist than bouncing incoherent banter off alluring sea nymphs. So many plot twists that my head was spinning like a ship in a nautical tornado. Should I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again... not sure. Maybe let this one swim a little before diving back in.
